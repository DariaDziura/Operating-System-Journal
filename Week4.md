# Initial System Configuration and Secure Remote Administration
## Objective
The objective of this phase is to establish secure remote administration of the server system by verifying network connectivity, installing and configuring SSH, and implementing foundational operating system security controls. This phase transitions the system from initial local access to controlled remote management via SSH, ensuring that administrative access is secure, auditable, and aligned with industry best practices.

All configuration changes are performed incrementally and verified at each stage to minimise the risk of misconfiguration or loss of administrative access [1].
